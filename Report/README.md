# CS 6335 -- `atoi` Proof of Correctness Report

## Setup
In order to edit and build the report, you will need a working LaTeX installation. The recommended LaTeX distribution is [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/), but any modern TeX distribution should be sufficient.

Follow the installation instructions of your preferred LaTeX distribution for your operating system.

If you use **VSCode** or **VSCodium**, an extension is available which provides support for LaTeX editing, compilation, and live preview called [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) (note that you still need a working LaTeX installation when using this extension).


## Report Folder Structure
```
└── Report/                     The folder containing all report-related artifacts
    ├── report.pdf              The rendered report PDF
    └── report.tex              The primary LaTeX source file
```
